## About
- I am excited to keep on learning and leveling up my work. I am not the type of guy to get demotivated when something go south. I always motivate myself to go further.

Hello! My name is Martin, I am from Slovakia and I’ve been interested in videography and photography for 7 years now. Before I found out about my passion for cinematography, I was just a regular guy that enjoyed spending time with his friends hanging outside or playing videogames. I discovered my passion in my first year of highschool after my teacher gave me a homework to create a video about a city I live in and I really enjoyed the whole process of creating. After that I switched my schools and started studying Film.


## Featured Projects

I have to say I love my job. I am working in a videoproduction called lifeREPORT for almost 3 years now. We are shooting huge events like Let it Roll which is one of the biggest DnB music festivals in Europe, we are shooting documentaries for Czech National Televison - ČT1-ČT2, or livestreaming sport  events like Czech Masters. In that 3 years I gained a huge amount of experience which I believe is mirroring in my work. I got used to working under really stressing conditions with a lot of responsibility on me which allows me to be always focused. I am a believer in a teamwork so I really like to collaborate with as many people as I can so we can combine our creative visions.

- I like shooting with models and try to express their personality trough my style. I really enjoy studio photography since it gives me full freedom of lighting aspect.
